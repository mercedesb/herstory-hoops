  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I embroider portraits of people we should be learning about and from. This
    collection centers women and gender non-conforming people that have been
    unnoticed, forgotten, or erased from the history we learn in school.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project began because I wanted to expand my definition of ancestors and
    familial history. <strong>Who has shaped us? Who can shape us?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    My portraits are simple, relying solely on shape and space to emphasize the
    uniqueness and beauty in faces we have overlooked. I use single-color line
    work and neutral backgrounds to focus the viewer's gaze.

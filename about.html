<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Women and gender non-conforming people are often erased from the history we
  learn in school.
</p>

<p>
  I embroider portraits of people we should be learning about and from. I use
  single-color line work and neutral backgrounds to focus the viewer's gaze
  directly into their faces.
</p>

<p>
  This project began because I wanted to expand my definition of ancestors and
  familial history. Who has shaped us? Who can shape us?
